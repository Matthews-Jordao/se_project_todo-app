# Simple Todo App

A simple, modern to-do list application that helps you keep track of your daily tasks. Add, complete, and remove tasks with ease.

## Functionality

## Technology

- **HTML5 & CSS3** for structure and styling.

- **OOP Principles:** The app uses ES6 classes (`Todo` and `FormValidator`) to encapsulate functionality.
- **UUID** for generating unique IDs for each to-do item.
